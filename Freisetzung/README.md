# Calculate the amounts of my release experiment


## Description

The script takes two excel sheets containing the results of the measurement with the Spark Multimode Microplate Reader from Tecan (very important so the excel sheet design matches!!) and from one excel sheet with the concentrations of the calibration solutions.

After processing the relevant data with pandas a new excel sheet is created where the calibration curve resulting concentrations in release supernatants and released amount per area are saved.
